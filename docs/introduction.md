##Welcome. Herein lies all documentation for the Safar Web Portal.

The Safar Web Portal is an online resource to provide a CMS for Service Providers and Administrators of the [Safar](https://safarapp.org) app.

It was built using React and ES6, and compiled using create-react-app.

This documentation was compiled by React-Styleguidist\*. For that reason, all methods are marked as public in the code comments to make them visible here. Their accessibility follows the ES6 standard.

This documentation is **Version 1.0** and was last edited on **04/15/2019**.

> \*Because React-Styleguidist is built from react-docgen, it only properly handles normal React components. Any classes that do not fit this standard will not render properly on this documentation and will be noted on that component's description.
